Information required
- thermodynamically irreversible
- chemically catalyzed reaction 
- all enzymes which catalyze reaction (ne, kcat_f, kcat_b)

-  chemical reactions (protein substrates, np)

internal exchange reactions (nm)

external exchange reactions 
- m*k-ex, m*k+ex (exchange rates)

- cell dry mass m (mass)
5397 State State_Mass Cell mass


- GAM
- used energy

What is the difference between enzymes and proteins?
